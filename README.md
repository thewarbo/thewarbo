Hi, Iâ€™m @thewarbo!

Most of the work I've done has been in R and Java, but that's all internal to the company
where I wrote it. (And that company wasn't actually a software company!) Here I've got a
few repositories where I'm trying out new languages and new frameworks (or, in the case of
PHP, a language I haven't used in a long time).

Currently I'm mostly working on the Big Easy Budget Game repo after showing up to a Code
for New Orleans meeting; I'm always a fan of grabbing and old codebase and poking around 
its innards until I can get it working again.
