Hi, Iâ€™m @thewarbo!

Most of the work I've done has been in R and Java, but that's all internal to the company
where I wrote it. (And that company wasn't actually a software company!) Here I've got a
few repositories where I'm trying out new languages and new frameworks (or, in the case of
PHP, a language I haven't used in a long time).

My current toy project is a Family Feud clone that I started writing while watching the 
game show segments on the 2021 [Desert Bus for Hope](https://desertbus.org) charity run, 
although that's been mostly put on hold while I've been doing the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) daily challenges and finally gotten enough 
Angular under my belt to submit a few pull requests to the FFXIV tool
[Teamcraft](https://github.com/ffxiv-teamcraft/ffxiv-teamcraft) that I use in my downtime.
